Course project for STAT 471/571/701: Modern Data Mining

This repository contains all materials associated with Group 21's final project for Modern Data Mining. Using an existing, publically available dataset, our primary objective was to determine whether we could use survey data to determine someone's diabetes diagnosis. Data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2019.html).
